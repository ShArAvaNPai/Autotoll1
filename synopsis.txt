1. SYNOPSIS
1.1 Title of the Project
“AutoToll AI - Automated Toll Collection System”

1.2 Objective of the Project
 To provide computerized data storage facility for toll transactions. Toll operators can easily search and manage records of vehicles.
 To reduce paperwork and computational time in manual toll booths.
 The application is user-friendly and operates with minimal professional technical skills required.
 It helps to keep the record of vehicle detections, owner details, and toll dues.
 It helps in managing the automated toll collection and generating traffic analytics.

1.3 Project Category
Web-based AI Application.

1.4 Software and Hardware requirements
1. Software Requirements
 Operating System : Linux / Windows 10 and above.
 Front End : React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
 Scripting Language : Python, TypeScript.
 Back End : FastAPI (Python).
 Back End DB : SQLite (via SQLAlchemy).
 AI Models : YOLOv8, EasyOCR.
 Browser : Mozilla Firefox, Chrome etc.

2. Hardware Requirements

 Hard Disk : Minimum Capacity - 100 GB (SSD recommended for performance).

1.5 Structure of the program
1.5.1 Analysis:
Our project helps toll administrators to manage vehicle movements and toll collection automatically. It uses computer vision to classify vehicles and recognize license plates.
Activities: -
 Automatic detection and classification of vehicles (Car, Truck, Bus, Motorcycle).
 License plate extraction and database cross-referencing.
 Automated toll calculation based on vehicle type and registry status.
 Real-time monitoring of toll lanes with automated transaction logging.
 Review queue for manual verification of low-confidence AI detections.
 Administrative dashboard for revenue and traffic volume analytics.
 Bulk registration of vehicles and owners via CSV/Excel import.

1.5.2 Data Structures:
Our project consists of following tables: -
1) Owners: -
Owner ID
Name
Contact Info
Photo Path
Registration Date

2) Vehicles: -
Vehicle ID
License Plate
Make & Model
Owner ID (Foreign Key)
Creation Date

3) Detections (History): -
Detection ID
Vehicle Type
License Plate
Confidence Score
Timestamp
Toll Amount
Status (Verified/Review)
Image Path
Known Vehicle ID
Authorization Status

1.6 Limitations: -
1. Reliable internet connection is mandatory for cloud/server-based processing.
2. Moderate server computing power is required for real-time AI inference.
3. System accuracy is dependent on image quality and camera positioning.

1.7 Future scope of the project: -
a. Integration with automated SMS/Email alerts for toll violations.
b. Implementing a mobile application for owners to pay dues instantly.
c. Support for multi-lane real-time video stream processing.
d. Integration with RFID/FasTag for multi-layered verification.
